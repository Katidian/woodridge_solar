# Woodridge Solar

This project maps the approximate boundaries of where Charlottesville-based Hexagon Energy proposes to place PV panels as part of its Woodridge Solar project, for which 
it is seeking a special use permit from Albemarle County, Virginia.

If approved, the Woodridge Solar facility would occupy approximately 1,500 acres in the southeast part of the county, with solar panels spread out in clusters over
that area (nearly 650 acres of solar panel total). 

For more on the proposed solar facility, see the [FAQ](https://myneighborsgroup.files.wordpress.com/2022/11/woodbridge-solar-faq-by-livable-cville.pdf) published 
by Livable Cville on November 15, 2022.

## PV panel boundaries
Hexagon Energy's May 16, 2022, [special use permit application](https://lfweb.albemarle.org/WebLink/DocView.aspx?id=1490382&dbid=0&repo=CountyofAlbemarle&cr=1) provides
geographical coordinates representing the boundaries of where the company proposes to place PV panels. The panels will not fill the entire area outlined in my map, as
they will occupy smaller sections within those boundaries.

## Making the map
The SUP application is a PDF file. I copied the coordinates data tables from the PDF into Excel and cleaned it there. I then used [this site](https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm) from convertcsv.com to create a GeoJSON file with the coordinates data.
